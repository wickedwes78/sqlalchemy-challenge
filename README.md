**Description**  
Module Challenge 10 - SQL Alchemy with Flask API

This challenge is used to undertake a climate analysis for a trip to Honolulu, Hawaii.

I have analysed the data for the period 2016-08-23 to 2017-08-23, being the last years data in the data set provided.

The analysis was undertaken using SQL Alchemy in a Jupyter Notebook and then again using a flask API.

**Credits**    
Code used was drawn from in class and google searches to find why code wasn't working. The coding followed similar to in class activities.
